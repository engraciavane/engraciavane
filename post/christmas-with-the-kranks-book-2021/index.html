    <p>Tim allen as luther and jamie lee curtis as nora seemed promising as the kranks, but they and the whole movie fall short of the novel. Christmas with the kranks starring tim allen and jamie lee curtis is one of my all time favourite christmas films and i watched it for the first time in a long time back in january which then made me want to check out john grisham&#039;s book skipping christmas which the movie is based on.
