        <p>There&#039;s a museum and a gift shop located across the street. It also takes place in the same town and makes references to things that are featured in the movie a christmas story (for example the leg lamp), which would be in theaters the next year (1983). The christmas tree shopping scene and many of the inside shots of the house, were filmed in toronto, ontario.</p>

        <p>The house used in the filming, called the christmas story house, has since been refurbished on the inside to look like it looked during the filming. Scenes from outside the parkers&#039; house were shot on location in the tremont neighborhood on the west side of cleveland, ohio. The film is supposed to take place in northern indiana in a town called holman, but the film was mainly filmed in cleveland, ohio and toronto, ontario.</p>
